26."When a Terraform file becomes corrupted, how can you restore it?"
```
```
27."In two environments, production and development, I have the same set of files. However, in the production environment, I don't want to create a database, but in the development environment, I want both an EC2 instance and an RDS instance. How can I ensure that only the EC2 instance is created in the development environment while both the EC2 instance and RDS instance are created in the production environment?"
```
```
28.what is count in terraform
```
```
29."For example, let's consider an EKS cluster and a node group. In Terraform, there are separate configurations for creating the EKS cluster and the node group. When running terraform apply, the process fails with an error stating that the EKS cluster is not active. How can this issue be resolved?"

```
38. What will be there in a slave?

39. You are doing CI, but this CI process requires

42. How do you typically create a Jenkins pipeline?

43. How can you deploy a Jenkins pipeline?

44. How can you achieve parallel stages in Jenkins?

45. Let's say you want to integrate some Jenkins APIs. For example, you have a Jenkins pipeline, and there is a Kubernetes pod. You want to trigger an API or a Jenkins pipeline using Jenkins API based on an event inside your Kubernetes, such as an XYZ event. How can you achieve this?

46. How do you reduce the Docker image size?

47. For example, you just want to know what processes are running inside your VM. The `top` command shows only the top processes, but you want a list of all processes. Which command would you use?

48. What is the difference between spot instances and reserved instances? Which is more cost-effective?

49. Let's say there are two regions, Mumbai and Singapore. There is one AMI present in the Singapore region, and you want to use that AMI in the Mumbai region, but the AMI is encrypted using a CMK. How can you do this?

52. What is the difference between stateless and stateful?

53. What is a customer gateway?

54. What is the difference between CloudWatch Alarms and EventBridge?

68. What is a layer in Dockerfiles?

69. What is an image manifest file?

70. What are CIDR ranges?

71. How do you decide on the CIDR ranges?

72. I want 510 usable hosts, so I used a /23 CIDR and created one subnet. What about the rest of the IPs?
